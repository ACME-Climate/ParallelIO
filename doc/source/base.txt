\mainpage Parallel I/O library (PIO)

The Parallel I/O (PIO) library has been developed over several years
to improve the ability of component models of the Community Earth
System Model (CESM) and Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)
to perform I/O. The interface is
sufficiently general to be useful to a broader spectrum of
applications. The focus of development has been on backend tools that
use the NetCDF file format. PIO currently supports NetCDF, PnetCDF and
ADIOS as the backend libraries.

PIO2 represents a significant rewrite of the PIO library in C (originally
implemented in Fortran language) and includes
a C API as well as the original F90 API. The new version of the library
also includes improvements in user data caching and aggregation
algorithms that significantly improve performance. A new decomposition strategy
has been introduced which gives the user more ability to tune I/O
communications.

This user's guide provides information on how to use the PIO library and
an overview of the internal algorithms used by the library.

Please review the ChangeLog that is included with the distribution for
up-to-date release information.
